# Advent of Rust

Advent of code is a great way to improve your programming skills. It's a month-long event where you can learn Rust by solving daily challenges. Each day, a new challenge is released, and you have 24 hours to solve it. The challenges are designed to be fun and educational, and they cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced algorithms.

Advent of Rust is just like Advent of Code, but with a focus on Rust, we'll focus on the core Rust language features like Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes, and more.

## Features of each day

- day-1: variable ownership and cloning
- day-2: borrowing and references
- day-3: floating-point precision and safe arithmetic in numerical computations
- day-4: implement new structs
- day-5: parsing raw strings into structs
- day-6: lifetimes and ownership
- day-7: implementing structs with associated functions and methods
- day-8: file I/O operations and error handling
- day-9: implementing the `From<T>` trait
- day-10: dereferencing structs
